# image_classification_model0
This project implements an image classification model using MobileNetV2 with Transfer Learning. It includes dataset preparation, training, evaluation, visualization, and real-time testing. The dataset features 7 classes: cats, dogs, humans, flowers, horses, bikes, and cars. The model is trained in TensorFlow/Keras with a 70-30 train-test split.
# 🚀 Digital Image Processing - Image Classification  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements an **image classification model** using **MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)** in **TensorFlow/Keras**. It classifies images into **7 different categories**:  
✅ **Cats**  
✅ **Dogs**  
✅ **Humans**  
✅ **Flowers**  
✅ **Horses**  
✅ **Bikes**  
✅ **Cars**  

The dataset was **automatically split (70-30 ratio)** into **train and test sets**, and the model was trained using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with pre-trained MobileNetV2**. The project includes:  
✔ **Dataset Preprocessing**  
✔ **Model Training & Evaluation**  
✔ **Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall**  
✔ **Correct & Incorrect Predictions Visualization**  
✔ **Manual Image Testing for Classification**
